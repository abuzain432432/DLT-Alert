I worked on this project during my tenour at Enigimatix. DLT Alert is
the first active monitoring and self-validating cyber insurance
company. Through direct integration with threat monitoring services,
external incident validation sources, and the fastest block chain
protocols DLT Alert approves claims in real-time improving customer
payouts, remediation times, and lowering premiums. This means less
risk and more uptime for our clients.and it can help you a lot during
